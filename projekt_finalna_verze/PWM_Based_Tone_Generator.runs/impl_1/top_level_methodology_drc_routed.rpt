LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell SIMP_C/countrst_reg_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) PWM/countrst_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.

Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch PWM/tone_out_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin PWM/tone_out_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>
